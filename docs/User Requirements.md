### Activity Tracking
- The user must be able to automatically record their computer usage with the application in order to review their activities.
- The user must be able to see which applications and documents they have worked with, to better understand their actual work activities.
- The user must be able to see how long they have used specific programs to better understand their time distribution.
- The user must be able to identify inactivity periods through the application in order to distinguish between breaks and actual working time.
- The user must be able to view which Teams meetings they attended to reconstruct their workday.
- The user must be able to see how long each Teams meeting lasted to understand how their time was spent.
- The user must be able to pause and resume activity tracking within the application.

### Activity Overview & Navigation
- The user must be able to navigate between different days to view past activities.
- The user must be able to view their daily routine in a simplified format for a quick overview of their activities, meaning:
  - The user must see the primary application used along with its window title, as this is key to identifying the task.
  - The user must see the primary application usage displayed in 15-minute time blocks for clarity.
  - The user must see consecutive identical entries grouped as a single combined item.
  - The user must be able to view the duration of each entry.
  - The user should be able to see when and for how long they attended Teams meetings.
  - The user should see the titles of the listed Teams meetings.
  - The user should be able to identify periods of inactivity.
  - The user should see only one activity at any given point in time, prioritized as follows: Teams meetings > inactivity > active program window.
  - The user should see inactivity and active Teams meetings rounded to the nearest 5 minutes.
- The user must see date labels in intuitive formats (e.g. “Today”, “Yesterday”) to easily navigate between relevant time periods.
- The user must see time durations in a user-friendly format (e.g. “2h 15m”) to quickly grasp the length of activities.
- The user must be able to see for each day how long tracking was active, how much time was spent actively working, and how much was inactive.

### Data Management & Privacy
- The user must be able to rely on the application to automatically save their activity data, eliminating the need for manual saves.
- The user must be able to access activity data from the past 30 days to identify medium-term usage patterns.
- The user must be able to trust that the application stores data locally only, to ensure their privacy is maintained.

### System Behavior
- The user must be able to trust that the application does not slow down their computer, so their normal workflow is not disrupted.
- The user must be able to retrieve their data unchanged after a system crash or restart, to avoid losing information.
- The user must be able to trust that the application resumes tracking automatically after sleep mode, to ensure no activities are missed.
- The user must be able to use the application across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to remain independent of their preferred OS.

### Data Portability
- The user MUST be able to relocate their data storage folder (e.g. to a Google Drive folder) in order to synchronize their data across multiple devices and get a complete picture of their digital activities.
